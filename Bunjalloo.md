# Installation #
## DLDI Patching ##
[Bunjalloo v0.2](BunjallooChangelog.md) and upwards requires [DLDI](http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/) patching. The steps to install are:

  * Unzip the [downloaded zip file](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list) to the root of your flash card.
  * Patch bunjalloo.nds with the [DLDI](http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/) tool.

DLDI is needed becuase the font files are no longer encrusted into the
binary. Instead they are read from the slot-1 media. Your flash card should have the
following directory structure:
```
/
|-- bunjalloo.nds
`-- data/
    `-- bunjalloo
        |-- config.ini
        |-- docs
        |   |-- copying
        |   `-- warranty
        |-- fonts
        |   |-- sans.img
        |   |-- sans.map
        |   |-- sans.pal
        |   `-- toolbar.png
        `-- user
            |-- ckallow.lst
            `-- search.cfg
```
The distribution zip file already contains these folders. Unzipping it to the
root folder of the flash card should create the appropriate structure. In fact the bunjalloo.nds file can be placed in any directory, it doesn't have to go in the root of the card - what matters is the _data_ directory.

  * `toolbar.png` is the image used for the buttons. It is an 8-bit color-mapped PNG image.
  * `ckallow.lst` contains URLs of sites that allow cookies.
  * `search.cfg` contains search keyword shortcuts. The "%s" is replaced with the search text

## Earlier Version ##
~~Bunjalloo v0.1~~ (Deprecated) used [DLDI](http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/) for viewing local files (those with a `file://` URL) only. To view remote `http://` URLs, no patching was required. Bunjalloo 0.1 could be run using Wireless Multiboot, without an attached cartridge.

## Edit Bookmarks ##
In order to edit a bookmark, first select the bookmark icon at the bottom of
the screen.

![https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-main.png](https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-main.png)

Next, **hold the stylus down** on the bookmark you want to edit for a couple
of seconds.

![https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-press.png](https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-press.png)

This causes a secret menu to appear! Select Edit or Delete from the menu.
Delete is irreversible I'm afraid, so be careful.

Editing the bookmark will lead you to the keyboard input screen. The first
line is the URL of the bookmark, the other lines are the text shown for this
marker.

## Edit Prefs ##

Changing the options is done via the option menu. To open this menu, click
the icon shown below - it looks like a spanner and screwdriver.

![https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-prefs-main.png](https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-prefs-main.png)

The icons shown on this menu are, from left to right:

![https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-prefs.png](https://wiki.quirkysoft.googlecode.com/hg/images/bunjalloo-prefs.png)

  * Return to the browser menu
  * Edit the cookie permissions list
  * Add the current domain/server to the allowed cookie list
  * Edit the search list (unimplemented!)
  * Add to the search list (unimplemented!)
  * Edit the options

Clicking on each active icon, apart from the return one of course, takes you
to a new screen with more self-explanatory options.

# About Bunjalloo #
Bunjalloo is a HTTP user agent (web browser) for the Nintendo DS. It has been implemented from scratch using [the whatwg user agent design rules](http://www.whatwg.org/).

## Availability ##
Bunjalloo is freely available under the GNU General Public License. See COPYRIGHT and http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/ for further details. Bunjalloo can be downloaded from the [download section](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list) of this site.

## Changing the font ##
Not available in 0.1. If you want to use a different font, then you will need the contents of the
[bunjalloo/tools](http://quirkysoft.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/bunjalloo/tools/) directory.
Run the convert.sh script passing the True Type Font name and the point size desired. It should generate 3 files, the raw image data, the palette and the mappings. Copy these into the /data/bunjalloo/fonts directory.

To add extra ranges of UTF-8 glyphs, then **all** the ranges required must be
passed on the command line after the size. By default the glyphs included are:
```
0x1f,0x7f 0xa0,0x100 0x20AC,0x20AD 8211,8212 8216,8218 8220,8221 8226,8226
```
These are used if no ranges are given.  Here 0x1f,0x7f means "the range 0x1f (31)
to 0x7f (127) inclusive". This covers all ASCII characters, the extra latin ones
(accented a's and e's, etc) and some common symbols - the Euro sign, copyright and
so on.

The font name is defined in _/data/bunjalloo/config.ini_. Change the line
`font=fonts/vera` to indicate the basename of the new font. For
example, to generate a new 12 point font from the font MyFont.ttf, one could do
this:
```
./convert.sh MyFont.ttf 12
cp myfont.* /media/disk/data/bunjalloo/fonts/
sed -i 's/vera/myfont/' /media/disk/data/bunjalloo/config.ini
```
The output font name is always all-lowercase.
