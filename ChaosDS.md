## Installation ##
Copy either ChaosDS.nds or ChaosDS.ds.gba to your development cartridge. It
doesn't use the media at all, everything is linked in to the binary, so no DLDI
patches are required. Run the game using your cartridge's shell.

The ChaosDS.nds file has also been tested using
[WMB for Linux](http://masscat.afraid.org/ninds/wifi_apps.php). It may also work
with WMB for Windows but I haven't been able to test it.
