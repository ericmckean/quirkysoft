# Compiling from source #
## Requirements ##
### General ###
  * [DevkitArm](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=124207) release `r24`
  * [libnds](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=151608) - the latest version
  * [SDL library](http://www.libsdl.org/) - to compile the PC version
    * optional, use --without-sdl to disable. This isn't recommended as testing is much easier with SDL enabled
  * [Python](http://www.python.org/), a Unix-like environment(tested on Ubuntu 7.10, partly tested on Windows Vista with MinGW from the [msysgit project](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/))
  * [waf](http://waf.googlecode.com) - the configuration and build system (included in the source tarballs from the download section, version 1.5.X for git)
### Chaos ###
In addition to the above, you will also need the following to compile Chaos:
  * [Sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
### Bunjalloo ###
In addition to the General requirements above, you will also need the following to compile Bunjalloo:
  * [libfat](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=197264) - the latest version
  * [dswifi](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=114505&package_id=199021) - the latest version
  * [Python Imaging Library (PIL)](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) to compile and change the fonts (optional)
  * [CppUnit](http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki) for unit tests
    * optional use --without-cppunit to disable
  * libpng, zlib, gif\_lib (part of libungif), libjpeg and matrixssl.

The libraries can be downloaded, unpacked, built and installed for the NDS using [this helper script in the /tools directory](http://github.com/quirky/bunjalloo/tree/master/tools/download-libs.sh). They are added to the $DEVKITPRO/libnds directory. This script uses subversion and patch, which you may have to install.
There are precompiled NDS libraries available in the [download area](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list) too, to
save you time. Install them to $DEVKITPRO/libnds and you'll be up and running in no time, hopefully.

For the Linux test version:
  * use the -dev versions that your OS vendor supplies for zlib, libjpeg, libgif and libpng.
  * Run "make install" for matrixssl and the unzip (minizip) library to install to /usr/local/.

On Windows, use --without-sdl and cross your fingers.
## Steps ##
  1. Install the tools as per the instructions on their respective websites
  1. Set the DEVKITPRO environment variable to point to the place you installed devkitARM and libnds
  1. Ensure the other tools are in your PATH
  1. Check out the code into a workspace and compile using [waf](http://waf.googlecode.com)'s autoconf emulation:
```
git clone git://github.com/quirky/bunjalloo.git
./configure
make
```
Alternatively, run directly with waf if the configure script fails (e.g. on Windows):
```
waf configure
waf build
```
This is for the `next` branch, which has a homogeneous build system, `master` [is messier](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/source/browse/wiki/Compiling.wiki?r=874#42). Source code can be downloaded if you don't have git installed.
  * [Download source code releases](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/downloads/list?can=2&q=label%3Asource) from the download section.
  * [Download a snapshot of the next branch](http://github.com/quirky/bunjalloo/tarball/next) from Github.

# Sending patches #
This is a mini how-to for sending patches. After making your changes, testing them out, committing them locally, etc, run:
```
  git format-patch -M HEAD^
```
Where `HEAD^` is whatever commit your patch corresponds to. This generates the `*.patch` files to send.
Once you have done this, let me know about the change by doing one of the following:
  * [Add an issue](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/issues/entry) with the change description and attach your patch file.
  * Post the patch with a description of what it does to the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/bunjalloo-discussion)
  * Send me an email - my address is **richard.quirk at gmail.com** - attach your patch file.
The source code is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/quirky/bunjalloo/tree/master) so if you are feeling brave, create a fork and send me a pull request there. There is a [complete guide to working on forks](http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications) and I'd recommend anyone interested in hacking on the code to set it up this way.

Thanks!
