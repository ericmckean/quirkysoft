## Next version ##
Release date - Early 2009
  * Experimental Woopsi UI

## The realistic ideas ##
Ideas that could realistically get implemented:
  * Search for text
  * Save image as...
  * More image-loading feedback ([issue 71](https://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/issues/detail?id=71))
  * Proper cookies saved between sessions
  * Proper cache that expires correctly
  * Better layout - add tables and lists
  * Bold, italic fonts
  * Sound effects for input
  * Better scroll input
  * On screen clock
  * Form submission fixes
  * Less bugs (OK, this isn't realistic :-)

## The pie-in-the-sky ideas ##
In an alternate universe, these features would also get added:
  * CSS support
  * Alternate text input methods
  * Tabbed browsing
  * Wifi configuration
  * Vertical view
  * Zoomed in view

## Forget it ##
These ideas will never appear:
  * Javascript
  * Flash
  * Support for extra RAM (I don't own a RAM gizmo)

If you want a feature added sooner rather than later, then [get coding!](http://code.google.com/p/quirkysoft/wiki/Compiling#Sending_patches)
