## About Chaos - The Battle of Wizards ##
Up to 8 wizards compete in a turn-based battle to the death, involving elves, dragons, fire, lightning and the odd Gooey Blob. The last wizard standing is the winner.

Chaos is a tactical combat video game for the Nitendo DS based on the 1985 Spectrum game 'Chaos - The Battle of Wizards'. Originally remade for the Gameboy Advance, this version has been rewritten once more from the ground up.
